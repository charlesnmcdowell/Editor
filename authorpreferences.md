# Author Style Preferences

## Prose Structure & Flow

**AVOID "Not X, but Y" constructions** - The author strongly dislikes this pattern and flags it consistently. Examples flagged:
- "Not pets," Lyra said flatly. "Wardens." → Changed to: "Wardens," Lyra said flatly.
- "She's a player. Not an NPC. Not a system entity. A human being." → Changed to: "She's a player. A human being."
- "These aren't prisoners. They're hardware." → Changed to: "They were being used as hardware."

**Prefer simple, direct statements** over complex comparative structures. When making distinctions, state the truth directly rather than contrasting with what something isn't.

## Word Choice & Repetition

**Avoid overusing technical terms** - The author flagged "lattice" as being used too much and called it "redundant and cliche." They prefer varied terminology:
- "lattice" was replaced with "pale geometry," "corruption veins," "pale veins," "corruption network," "pale patterns," etc.

**Vary technical vocabulary** to avoid reader fatigue, even when referring to the same concept.

## Immersion & Genre Consistency

**NEVER reference "gamer" concepts directly** - The author stated this "breaks immersion." Examples flagged:
- "Kenji's gamer instincts" → Changed to: "Kenji's tactical instincts"
- "gamer brain" → Avoid entirely

**Maintain fantasy world consistency** - Modern gaming terminology should be translated into in-world equivalents that fit the fantasy setting.

## Character Voice & Repetition

**Reduce references to character's mental processes** - The author noted "we are being redundant mentioning kenji's brain too often." Examples:
- "Kenji catalogued them with the part of his brain that refused to feel things" → This type of phrasing was flagged as overused

**Vary how you describe character thinking/processing** rather than repeatedly referencing "brain," "instincts," or mental compartments.

## Structural Changes (Noted but not implemented in this edit)

**The author requested major plot changes** that weren't applied to this version:
- Replace the frequency/teeth pain opening with Lyra noticing corruption and them having to flee
- Have Kenji convince Lyra to hold off on cleansing until after finding Grove leadership
- Show Lyra attempting to cleanse corruption but drawing unwanted attention

These suggest the author wants more focus on **strategic decision-making** and **environmental awareness through Lyra's abilities** rather than physical discomfort descriptions.

## Combat & Action Scenes

**Kenji should handle combat, Lyra should notice environmental details** - The author noted "kenji is the fighter, he's good at taking out the mobs and tanking them with Lyra support. Lyra notices most of the environmental stuff thanks to her druid like powers."

This indicates a preference for **clear role definition** in action scenes rather than overlapping capabilities.
